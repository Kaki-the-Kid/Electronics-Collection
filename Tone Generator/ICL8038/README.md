# Tone Generator

The ICL8038 chip serves as a function generator capable of producing three fundamental signals including Sine, Square, and Triangle waveforms. Moreover, the chip offers the ability to fine-tune crucial waveform parameters like Frequency and Duty Cycle. By incorporating external resistors and capacitors, the frequency of the signal can be adjusted within a range of 0.001KHz to 300KHz.
